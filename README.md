# CSV Reconciler

Browser-based transaction reconciliation tool. Upload two or more CSV files and get a colour-coded diff of mismatches, missing transactions, and duplicates — entirely in the browser, no data leaves your machine.

4. Review the in-page diff table and download CSV reports.

## Privacy
All processing happens locally in the browser. No files or data are sent to any server.
